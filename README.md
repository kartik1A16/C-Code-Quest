# My First Repository: C-Code-Quest

Welcome to my first C Language repository! This project is a collection of simple C programs that help me learn and practice the fundamentals of programming. If you're new to C or GitHub like me, you'll find this a great starting point!

## About This Project

This repository contains various C programs that explore basic programming concepts, including:

- Variables and data types
- Control flow (if statements, loops)
- ~Functions~
- ~Arrays and strings~
- ~Pointers~

I created these programs to strengthen my understanding of C and improve my coding skills.

## What You'll Find

- **Simple Programs**: Each program is designed to demonstrate a specific concept in C.
- **Comments**: I've added comments to explain what each part of the code does, making it easier to understand.
- **Makefile**: A simple Makefile is included to help compile the programs easily.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   Open your terminal and run the following command (replace `yourusername` with your GitHub username):

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kartk1A16/C-Code-Quest.git
   cd C-Code-Quest
2. **Install a C Compiler**:
   You need a C compiler to run the programs. Here are some options based on your operating system
     -**Linux**: Use your package manager (e.g., sudo apt install build-essential).
     -**Windows**: Install MinGW or use an IDE like Code::Blocks.
     -**macOS**: Use Xcode Command Line Tools (xcode-select --install).

## How to Use the Programs
To compile and run a program:
  1.  Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory.
  2.  Use the Makefile to compile the desired program:
      ```bash
      make program_name
  3.  After compilation, run the program with:
      ```bash
      ./program_name
  Replace program_name with the name of the program you want to run
